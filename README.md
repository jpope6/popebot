# popebot

Popebot is a UCI compatible chess engine written entirely in Golang. This project is a work in progress and is not yet completed, but if you would like to do play it you can do so [here](https://lichess.org/@/popebot).

Note: If the bot is not online and you want to play it, send me a message!
